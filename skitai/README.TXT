Skitai App Engine Library (SAEL) is a kind of branch of 
Medusa Web Server - A High-Performance Internet Server 
Architecture.

Medusa is different from most other servers because it 
runs as a single process, multiplexing I/O with its various 
client and server connections within a single process/thread.

SAEL orients light-weight and strengthen networking jobs 
with external resources - HTTP / HTTPS / RPC / ProstgreSQL - 
keeping very low costs.

 - It can serve XML/JSONRPC, Web Site etc.
 - It can request massive RPC/HTTP(S) connections via 
   asynchronous socket framework provided by Skitai 
   App Server at your apps.
 - Provide asynchronous dbapi to PostgreSQL

It also influenced by Zope and Flask a lot.
